# Trading-Bot
ABSTRACT: The aim of this thesis is to build a trading bot for crypto trading and implement different strategies, which will be analyzed, proposed and finally traded by the bot. To solve the raised challenge, we use programmatic solutions to build our application, create different strategies, test results and draw a conclusion. Our application consists of two parts: a desktop application and a web application. These are implemented in Python programming language using various external libraries. To create the strategies, we have examined different trading indicators, and then we combine them.  To trade symbols and test strategies, we need live and historical market data, so we connect to two crypto exchanges, Binance and Bitmex. The interaction between the exchanges and our application is done via APIs. We decide on the optimal exit conditions for different strategies during testing, and then use this to create the final strategies and calculate efficiencies for them.
